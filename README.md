## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features. The dataset contains information about different houses, including their size, location, and other relevant factors. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices accurately.

### Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- Preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models.
- Compare the performance of different models.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for this project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bambamivan/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```

Next, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the project, open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the notebook file and run the cells sequentially. This will guide you through the EDA, preprocessing, and modeling steps.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- **Id**: Unique identifier for each house.
- **SalePrice**: The price of the house (target variable).
- **LotArea**: Size of the lot in square feet.
- **OverallQual**: Overall material and finish quality (1-10 scale).
- **YearBuilt**: Year the house was built.
- **TotalBsmtSF**: Total basement area in square feet.
- **GrLivArea**: Above grade (ground) living area in square feet.
- **GarageCars**: Size of garage in car capacity.

The dataset may contain missing values and outliers, which will be addressed during preprocessing.

## Modeling

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is crucial to understanding the dataset. It involves:

- Visualizing distributions of features.
- Checking for correlations between features and the target variable.
- Identifying missing values and outliers.

We will use histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize the data.

### Preprocessing

Data preprocessing includes:

- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Normalizing numerical features.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Model Selection

We will implement the following models:

1. **Linear Regression**: A simple model to establish a baseline.
2. **Random Forest**: A more complex model that can capture non-linear relationships.

### Model Evaluation

We will evaluate the models using metrics such as:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared value

This will help us understand the performance of each model.

## Results

After running the models, we will present the results in a clear format. This will include:

- Comparison of MAE, MSE, and R-squared for each model.
- Visualizations of predicted vs. actual prices.
- Insights on which features are most influential in predicting house prices.
